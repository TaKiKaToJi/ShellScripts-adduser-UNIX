# ShellScripts-adduser-UNIX
This Bash script dynamically creates users on various Linux distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS, Rocky, AlmaLinux, Debian) by reading usernames and passwords from an external users.txt file. It detects the appropriate admin group (wheel or sudo) based on the OS and automatically adds users to the group, ensuring easy user management.
