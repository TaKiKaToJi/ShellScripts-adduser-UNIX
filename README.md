User Management Script
This script allows you to easily create new Linux users and assign them administrative privileges by adding them to the appropriate group (sudo or wheel), depending on the Linux distribution. It is designed to work on multiple distributions including CentOS, Ubuntu, Rocky Linux, Debian, AlmaLinux, and more.

The users and their passwords are stored in an external users.txt file, making it easy to add or modify users without changing the script itself.

Features
Cross-distro support: Works on multiple distributions, automatically detecting whether to use the sudo group (for Ubuntu/Debian) or the wheel group (for RHEL-based distributions like CentOS, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux).
External configuration: The list of users and passwords is stored in an external users.txt file, so no code changes are needed to add new users.
Automated user creation: The script creates users, sets their passwords, and assigns them to the appropriate administrative group.
Dynamic user display: After creating the users, the script lists only the newly added users from /etc/passwd.
Supported Distributions
Ubuntu
Debian
CentOS

How to Use
1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/user-management-script.git
cd user-management-script
2. Create or modify the users.txt file
The users.txt file should contain the list of users you want to add, along with their passwords, in the following format:

txt
Copy code
username:password
Example users.txt:

txt
Copy code
nueng:compcenter
nat:compcenter
wathit:compcenter
newuser:newpassword
You can add as many users as you need by adding new lines in the same format.

3. Give the script execution permissions
bash
Copy code
chmod +x add_users.sh
4. Run the script
To execute the script and create the users listed in users.txt, run the following command as root or with sudo:

bash
Copy code
sudo ./add_users.sh
5. Verify the newly added users
After the script runs, it will display the newly added users from the /etc/passwd file. You can also verify by checking the /etc/passwd file manually:

bash
Copy code
cat /etc/passwd
Script Breakdown
detect_os() Function
This function detects the operating system by reading the /etc/os-release file. Based on the distribution, it sets the appropriate admin group:

For Ubuntu and Debian, it sets ADMIN_GROUP="sudo".
For CentOS, Rocky, AlmaLinux, and RHEL, it sets ADMIN_GROUP="wheel".
add_user() Function
This function:

Creates a new user with the specified username.
Sets the userâ€™s password.
Adds the user to the admin group (sudo or wheel, depending on the detected OS).
users.txt File
The script reads usernames and passwords from the users.txt file. Each line contains a username and its corresponding password, separated by a colon. This allows for easy updates without changing the script.

Displaying Newly Added Users
After all the users are created, the script will use cut and grep commands to filter and display the newly added users from the /etc/passwd file.

Customization
To add more users, simply update the users.txt file with the desired usernames and passwords, then re-run the script. No changes to the script are required.
